# FofDA_Project

This repository is for the project as part of the Fundatmentals of Data Analysis Module.

In this notebook a simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.

The notebook contains a simple linear regression on the dataset, a simple linear regression on the dataset with outliers removed and a polynomial regression on the dataset with outliers removed.

Each type of regression is compared against each other.

The python liabries used within the notebook are:

* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Sklearn
* Pandas


### Set up

Applications used for completion of the tasks are [The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [cmder](http://cmder.net/)

Distribution of the Python used is [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). 

###  How to run the code

1. Make sure that you have Python installed
2. Download or clone current repository "numpy.random"
3. Open Command Interpreter and naviagate to relevant directory
4. Run Jupyter notebook
5. On the home page of opened Jupyter server select PfDA- Assignment.ipynb
